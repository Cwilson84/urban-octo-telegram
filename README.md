# <Horiseon Digital Marketing Optimization>

## Module One Challenge

This challenge was to refactor the code for a fictitious marketing comapny (Horiseon) to use semantic HTML, while retaining the form and function of the original site.  Improvements include:

- Updated the code to make use of semantic HTML;
- Repaired a non-fucntioning link;
- Added a title for SEO/Accessibility;
- Restructured CSS to follow HTML flow;
- Combined many superfluous selectors;

## Credits

I leaned on a great many resources during this challenge, as I am quite new to both coding and tech in general. Websites like [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com), [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) and just [Google](https://www.google.com) were invaluable when stuck. Not only for their direct resources, but by the very design of their pages and use of HTML and CSS.
